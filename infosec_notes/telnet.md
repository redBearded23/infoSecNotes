# Telnet

- Default port: 23
- application protocol which allows with the use of a telnet client to connect to and execute commands on a remote machine that's hosting a telnet server
- will establish a connection with the server. The client will then become a virtual terminal- allowing you to interact with the remote host
- because Telnet sends all messages in clear text and has no specific security mechanisms it has been replaced by SSH in most implementations
- telnet client via command-line: `telnet`
  - Syntax:
    `telnet <IP> <port>`
- for the most part poor access control
