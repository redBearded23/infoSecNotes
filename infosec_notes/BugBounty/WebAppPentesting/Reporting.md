# Reporting

Report consists of:

## Title

- describing the vulnerable site, endpoint, and the vulnerability type
  - good title helps sec teams prioritize reports as they are making their way through their inbox
  - helps sec teams identify and search for possible duplicates faster
  - question to ask: "How do I describe this vuln in 140 characters or less"
  - include either functionality or the vulnerable asset or endpoint, as well as the vuln type and its impact
  - checklist:
    - what is the vulnerability
    - where does it occur
    - potential severity
    - e.g.: `IDO on https://xyz.com Leads to Account Takeover for All Users`

## Summary

- Report summary is clear and concise
- contains all the information needed to understand a vulnerability including what the bug is found and what an attacker can do with it

## Severity Assessment

- Low/Medium/High/Critical
  - Low: bug doesn't have potential to cause a lot of damage
  - Medium: bug impacts users or organization in moderate way or is high-severity issue that's difficult for malicious hacker to exploit
  - High: impacts large number of users; consequences can be disastrous for these users
  - Critical: impacts majority of user base or endangers organizations core infrastructure
- CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) & CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) score describing the criticality of the vuln
  - CVSS calculator is broken down in 8 different metrics to define the score:
    - Attack vector: how can vuln be exploited
    - Attack complexity: conditions beyond your control that must be met in order for the vuln to be exploited
    - Privileges Required: indicates the type of privs an attacker must achieve before exploiting the vuln
    - User Interaction: requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable component
    - Scope: how does successful attack impact components other than the vulnerable component?
    - Confidentiality: impact on confidentiality of the information resources exploited by the vuln
    - Integrity: impact on integrity of a successfully exploited vuln; refers to trustworthiness and veracity of information
    - Availability: refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself

## Reproduction Steps

- step-by-step reproduction steps
- think of how you can help a friend reproduce this vuln on the target site without any prior knowledge or experience with the application
- how can I help someone thats never used this application replicate the vuln by following the reproduction steps
- Structure:
  - Description/introduction
  - Working proof-of-concept including every step necessary from the beginning all the way to the end where the vuln is fully exploited
    - ask theses questions:
      - “Does this require the user to be authenticated? If so, where do they sign up?”. Make sure you include a link to it
      - “How can the security team receiving the vulnerability, access the vulnerable component?”. While it’s great to directly link to the vulnerable component, It’s always recommended to describe what menus to navigate through, in order to avoid any complications. We recommend including links as well as how to navigate to the particular functionality
      - “What additional information can I include to make sure they are able to reproduce this issue”. This is very important, especially if you are having a hard time reproducing a vulnerability on your own because of some conditions or issues on the website
  - HTTP request as text (no screenshot)
  - HTTP response or the DOM if needed
- an impact statement to help security team understand worst case that could happen if the vuln was fully exploited

## Provide Proof-of-Concept

- include video, screenshots or photos documenting the exploit --> = Proof-of-Concept
- include crafted URLs, scripts or upload files used to attack the application

## Description of Impact and Attack Scenarios

- to help security team fully understand potential impact of vulnerability
- to explain what consequences of exploiting the vuln would actually look like
- good impact section illustrates how an attacker can realistically exploit a bug

## Recommend Possible Mitigations

- recommend a comprehensive fix for the vulnerability
- only give recommendations if you completely understand the applications behaviour
